## Download Python

I started downloading Python from the site official version 3.6.9 [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

<br /> 

Then I checked that Python It works fine by typing the following command in the command prompt :

```python --version```

`py --version/`

`py`

<br /> 


Then I downloaded the OpenCV library by typing this command :

`pip install opencv-python`

<br /> 

Then I downloaded the code on [this page](https://github.com/AShenaifi/OpenCV), decompressed the file and then copied the path as in the picture :

Then I wrote the name of the file that contains the codes, which is (completed.py). After that I turned on the camera directly, and the program succeeded in recognizing my face.
